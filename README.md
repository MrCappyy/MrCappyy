# MrCappy

I build real shit.
Currently working on [DynaCraft](https://dynacraft.net), a custom Minecraft MMORPG server coded from scratch. No paid plugins, no shortcuts, everything’s mine.

## Current Focus

* **DynaCraft** – Fully modular backend, original combat systems, MMO-scale logic
* **BerryNode** – Self-hosted Minecraft infra. Custom panel. Real control.
* **Plugture** – Visual Minecraft plugin builder. AI-powered, dev-first.
* **CappyEngine** – My own game engine. Just because I can. Yeah idk.

## Tech Stack

**Backend**:
C#, Java, Kotlin, Python, Go, Node.js, Bash, Lua - whatever gets the job done.

**Frontend**:
React, TypeScript, Astro, Tailwind, HTML/CSS/JS (vanilla or not), Svelte when I’m bored.

**Infrastructure / DevOps**:
Docker, Linux, NGINX, MySQL, Redis, GitHub Actions, Pterodactyl, CI/CD scripting, self-hosted panels, local LLM serving.

**Minecraft**:
Paper, Purpur, Fabric, custom plugin APIs, data models, real NMS work.

**Other Stuff**:
C, C++, Rust (if needed), SQL, Markdown, OpenGL, ImGui, a bit of everything.
If it compiles, I’ve probably broken it at some point and fixed it better.

## Projects

### DynaCraft MMORPG

Custom-coded and actually modular:

* Real combat, stat scaling, and leveling
* Equipment, crafting, economy systems
* Shard-wide player sync (not Bungee hacks)
* Written from scratch — every plugin, every system

### Plugture

A visual plugin builder for Minecraft, node-based, AI-assisted, and not made for kids.

### CappyEngine

Advanced C# 2D game engine. No Unity. No tutorials. Just mine.

### Other Stuff

Sometimes I open-source things if I think they’re useful. No commissions. No forks.

*Not for hire. Don’t DM me to code something. I’m building my own shit.*
